Python-DevEnv
-------------

**Python-DevEnv** (PDE) is a simple development environment setup 
script for Python projects. 

It asks a series of questions about your project, then generate an 
appropriate ``setup.py`` and ``README.rst``.  

If you like, it can also generate a ``.pylintrc`` with some useful
settings for Pylint. (Use ``-p``.)  The settings are a little more 
liberal then the basic options, but still very useful.


Usage
=====

``usage: pde [-h] [-p] [-g] [-v] [-o OUTPUTDIR] [--name NAME]``
``           [--description DESCRIPTION] [--author AUTHOR] [--email EMAIL]``
``           [--website WEBSITE] [--projversion PROJVERSION]``
``           [--projlicense PROJLICENSE] [--platforms PLATFORMS]``
``           [--source SOURCE] [--test TEST]``

Python-DevEnv is a simple setup script generator to help with starting a
python project. It can automatically generate ``pylint`` configs and easy ``setup.py``
script commands for unittesting, style testing and git support. All questions
can be overridden with command line arguments as detailed below.

**optional arguments**::
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p, --pylint          Generate .pylintrc file for pylint
  -g, --gitignore       Generate .gitignore file with python and cython
                        settings
  -v, --version         Python-DevEnv version display
  -o OUTPUTDIR, --outputdir OUTPUTDIR
                        Output directory
  --name NAME           Project name
  --description DESCRIPTION
                        Project description
  --author AUTHOR       Project Author name
  --email EMAIL         Project/Author email address
  --website WEBSITE     Project website url
  --projversion PROJVERSION
                        Project version
  --projlicense PROJLICENSE
                        Project license
  --platforms PLATFORMS
                        Project platforms, comma seperated string
  --source SOURCE       Project source code location
  --test TEST           Project unittest code location


Output Usage
============

The generated setup script has additional commands that should
be useful when working on any Python project.

``python setup.py test``: Automatically runs ``unittest`` discovery
on the provided test directory.

``python setup.py style``: Run pylint style checking on the source
directory provided. If the ``-p`` switch was not used, this will
complain because there will be no ``.pylintrc`` file in the project
directory however one can be manually made. 

``python setup.py prep``: Will run the test and style command. Handy to
ensure that everything is working before a distribution or commit.

``python setup.py commit [-m message]``: Allows simple git integration by
running `git add .` followed by a `git commit` with an optional
message provided by the ``-m`` switch.

``python setup.py pypiup``: Performs a distutils check to ensure that
project meta data is up to spec then creates an sdist and attempts to
upload it to the PyPi package repository.
